# Digital Paper theme for jsonresume

This is a theme for JSON Resume. It is available via npm:

[DEMO](https://themes.jsonresume.org/digital-paper)

## Getting started

To test the theme, this is what you'll need:

- [npm](http://howtonode.org/introduction-to-npm)

If you're on Linux, you can simply run:

sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy npm
```

Or if you're on OSX and got [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed:
```
brew install node
```

### Install the command line

We're going to use the official [resume-cli](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli) to run our development server.

Go ahead and install it:

```
sudo npm install -g resume-cli
```
### Serve theme

While inside the theme folder, simply run:

```
resume serve
```

You should now see this message:
